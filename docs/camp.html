<h2>Welcome To BAAAHS Station!</h2>

<p>First off... Yay!!! We’re so happy to have
Ewe as part of this magical experience as we embark on our third year with the Big-Ass Amazingly
Awesome Homosexual Sheep. We are looking forward to a transformative,
exhilarating and ever-evolving week. To set some context for making this the
best burn ever, we wanted to share some important things about the camp.</p>

<p>So we know this is a long ass document but
there are so many important and exciting things to share. Please take the time
to review everything once but just to help our skimmers, here is an outline:</p>

<h3><a name="WeWantEWE">We Want Ewe!!!</a></h3>

<p>You’re part of BAAAHS Station because you’ve
worked hard. You’ve helped take BAAAHS from a leaping lamb of an idea to a big
ol’ low hanging disco balled BAAAHD-ass. You are the people who are creating
the BAAAHS community, and we do mean COMMUNITY.</p>

<p>As you arrive, even before you put up your
tent, please introduce yourself to other flock members. There will be more than
60 of us in our camp, so we need to make ourselves known to one another. It’s
really simple: make friends and make more than friends, because, for this week
and beyond we are each other’s chosen BAAAHS family. Be awesome to each other.
So let’s make whoopee, show each other our favorite body part, make memories,
jump in and help however we can, and if you aren’t sure, ask.</p>

<p>We are a part of each other’s burn. And this
burn (like the burn before, and the burn before that) will be the best burn ever.
How do we know? Because we are all together with open hearts, open minds, open
arms, and very cuddly sensibilities that we will share with everyone who
crosses our path.</p>

<p>We know some of you are coming in groups
(little groups, big groups, couples, entourages). The beauty of smaller groups
comes when we can start morphing the strengths that come with established
relationships into a larger group dynamic. We can get a lot more accomplished
as a cohesive, collaborative entity than we can as individuals.
If you see a lamb that looks lost, bring them into the fold.</p>

<p>Keeping a collaborative flow all week will
start by looking outward, and asking (out loud even) how can we help each
other, how can we help those who visit our sheep, and most of all how we
can all help the BAAAHS project reach new levels of inclusion, interactivity and
awesomeness through our combined efforts and energy by sharing as we go.</p>

<p>As the largest queer mutant vehicle on the playa we've become iconic in
the Burning Man community, and you are an integral part of BAAAHS' story!</p>

<h2><a name="CampBasics">Camp Basics</a></h2>

<p><b>Our Address:</b>7:00 and D (as in <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Donniker">Donniker</a>)</p>

<p>First and foremost, BAAAHS Station believes in the
Golden Rule of Radical Self-Reliance. You must supply what you need to
keep yourself alive. This means taking care of yourself and taking care
of those in your group.</p>

<p>We will be providing some infrastructure, meals, and some awesome community space,
but most of our focus is on getting this big-ass sheep out on the playa.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://survival.burningman.com">Burning Man Survival Guide</a> if
you have any questions on what that means.</p>

<h2><a name="CampRules">Camp Rules</a></h2>

<p><b>BE AMAZINGLY AWESOME.</b> This is a BE AWESOME economy. Give some of
your awesomeness to every person you encounter; you’ll get awesomeness back in
return. We promise.</p>

<p><b>When in doubt, the answer is "yes"!</b> There's no chance there'd be a big
gay sheep roaming the playa today if we'd always played it safe.</p>

<p><b>Keep the pigs at bay.</b> Unless it’s role-play, getting
arrested isn’t hot. Never bring law enforcement back to camp. The best way to
do this is to avoid them altogether and don’t get in trouble. Be discreet in
camp and out on the Playa.</p>

<p>Guidance for speaking to law enforcement and other
great tips can be found <a href="http://www.lawyersforburners.com/home">here</a>
  (<a href="http://www.lawyersforburners.com/home">http://www.lawyersforburners.com/home</a>).</p>

<p>If for some reason you encounter law enforcement, here are some ways to diffuse the situation:</p>

<ul style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; margin: 1em;">
  <li>Officer, my name is [give your real name].</li>
  <li>Please explain to me your probable cause for stopping me, and if it seems reasonable to me, I will give you my personal identification information.</li>
  <li>I politely refuse to give you any further information.</li>
  <li>I do not consent to any search of me or my belongings, tent, vehicle or camp.</li>
  <li>Am I free to go?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING on BAAAHS or in common camp areas.</b>
This is both for safety and courtesy. We don’t want to have a big ass amazingly
awesome singed metal hulk... we’d have to change our acronym. If you must
smoke cigarettes in camp, please limit it to your personal areas. Please let your
visitors know we’d like to keep shared camp areas smoke-free.</p>

<p><b>No smoking illegal substances in public areas.</b>
That means pot, top of the list. Even if you have a medical marijuana license.
In Nevada, it’s still ILLEGAL. The quickest way to get a member of one of the
multiple law enforcement agencies visiting you is a whiff of telltale Mary
Jane.</p>

<p>Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) have a pretty
loose definition of public areas: under a shade structure, inside your tent
with the door open, behind your car. All public areas are the same as the open
playa in their eyes. We don’t want to tell you what to do, but we do want to
help you not get a citation. There are lots of things you can do that don’t
involve smoking pot.  If you do smoke pot,
be discreet and be smart. Oh, and remember that part about not smoking on the
BAAAHS? Ditto.</p>

<p><b>Law
Enforcement and Illicit Substances.</b> So I’m not
saying that you are going to do illicit substances while you are at Burning
Man, but if you happen to be contemplating some such activity…</p>

<p>Here are some simple tips:</p>

<ul style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; margin: 1em;">
<li><b>In-the-open is bad.</b> Don’t do anything in wide-open
areas. Even at night-time. You may not see anyone but <b>night vision
goggles</b> can clearly see you doing what you shouldn’t be doing. Remember, LEOs
have a loose definition of public areas.</li>

<li><b>Private is good.</b> Go into a
porta pottie. Go into a protected spot. Mummify yourself in your sleeping bag.</li>

<li><b>Never on the bus.</b> Very,
very, very bad idea. Do not do it on the bus when it’s moving, when it’s still,
when it’s in camp. LEOs could decide to seize our little sheep and that would be a bummer.</li>

<li><b>Dark is better.</b> If you do
something in your tent, please, please, don’t do a Bunraku shadow puppet theater show in there
for all the world to see. Turn out your lights. You may think you are discreet
but the shadows are giving us a blow by blow (so to speak).</li>

<li><b>No whippets.</b> DUH! Cops know what these are
and look for them lying around camps and then go and search your shit. Keep it
in your tent, Mary.</li>

<li><b>Gifting/Selling.</b> Um? Okay,
it’s always nice to give gifts. But LEOs have this very backwards view of it—they
call it trafficking, distribution, and sale. If it isn’t a good friend, don’t do it.</li>

<li><b>If you see something, say something.</b> If guests on BAAAHS or in camp
are doing something illegal, tell them they need to take it elsewhere. Explain that
they're putting us at risk of having the vehicle confiscated or camp searched.
But nice, but be firm.</li>

</ul>

<p>At the end of the day, remember the mantra:
be discreet and be smart. Every member of BAAAHS Station needs to help protect our
camp. We have seen too many people make a little slip and
have it ruin the rest of their Burn. Or other people’s burn. Not nice.
‘Nuff said.</p>

<h2><a name="WhatWillWeProvide">What Will We Provide?</a></h2>

<p><b>Fun.</b> Absolutely. 100% Guaranteed. If you don’t have a good time, I
will personally call Cher and ask her to turn back time.</p>

<p><b>Awesomeness.</b> This is one of our calls to action. It’s not the Big-Ass
Amazingly Adequate Sheep, it’s the Big-Ass Amazingly <i>Awesome</i> Sheep!
so be extra cool to everyone we interact with, even the really annoying drunk ones.</p>

<p><b>Opportunity to share.</b> While we are radically self reliant that
doesn’t mean you can’t bring delicious treats or surprises to share with us.
Signature drinks, dishes, moves, and looks can be shared as often and regularly
as you have the ability to. I, for one, would like an ice cream cake still
frozen, served mid-day Thursday.</p>

<p><b>Fabulicious camp members.</b> In our last two years, BAAAHS Station has
been home to wonderful people from all ends of the Earth. Our band of misfits
includes people from all walks of like, and I promise, they are all fabulous.</p>

<p><b>Delicious dinners.</b> Breaking bread together is key to every community,
and of course we're gonna have some delicious loaves (and/or buns) for that purpose.
Dinner will happen around sundown every night. It'll be nommy. There'll be veggie options. We'll
need lots of help making the kitchen work, and keeping it sanitary! You'll need to
bring your own plates, silverware, etc., and you'll probably want to wash them too,
unless you like to keep a layered historical record your meals.</p>

<p>We'll have hot water and some simple stuff for breakfast (think coffee, instant
oatmeal, fruit). Lunch is up to you. Nevada state health code and sanitary considerations
mean we can't use the camp kitchen except for dinner prep by kitchen staffers. If you're
planning to cook outside of the nightly meals, you'll need to bring your own BBQ or
gas stoves.</p>

<p><b>Communal space.</b> We’ll provide some great central social and lounging spaces. Comfy couches,
good conversation, puppy piles.</p>

<p><b>Luxurious open air showers.</b> Come see the best show in town—now with two exciting showers!
Count them. Two!!! A pump shower and a second shower for all you sun shower bag owners. 
We will be handling grey water removal. All you have to do is bring your
dirty-ass self<sup>*</sup> (and soap). <small><sup>*</sup>Dirty ass not required to use showers.</p></small>

<p><b>Water.</b> We will be providing water—the very essence of life itself. We
will be planning for about 2 gallons of water per person per day. You should still
bring some water of your own so you can start hydrating on the way to
camp. To best make use of the camp water supply, please consider
bringing larger refillable water containers for your group. Fewer trips to the
main tank will help with sanity and convenience. <a
href="http://www.thereadystore.com/5-gallon-stackable-water-container">5 gallon refillable water cubes</a> are a great idea.</p>

<p><b>Gray water removal.</b> That means water from showers and dishes. That
DOES NOT mean bodily fluids (or, eek, solids). If you have a gallon jug of self-made
'sun tea' in your tent, you need to empty that in the porta potties.</p>

<p><b>Assorted other niceties.</b> Bike racks, shade structures, a nicely chilled yurt.</p>

<p><b>Campy programming.</b> For your shear delight, we are planning
some sashay and shantalicious programming throughout the week. We’ll tell you
more about this as we approach the burn. Your own contributions are especially solicited here!</p>

  
<h2><a name="CampDues">Camp Dues</a></h2>

<p>We are asking for $400 plus a $100 deposit to cover camp costs (including vehicles to bring everything
to the playa, water (and grey water removal), delivery of fresh produce and other dinner bits,
volunteer treats, shade structures, and some other surprises. There's a little extra built in to
help cover some of the costs of operating and maintaining our sexy beast of an art car.</p>

<p>The deposit is to help ensure everybody does what they sign up to do. Show up for your shifts (or if
you're too dessicated to move, find a friend to cover for you). Take your LEAVE NO TRACE sweep seriously.
You'll get your deposit back after the burn.</p>

<p>We know $400 is a lot for some people. Don’t worry. In the spirit of Burning Man, gifting is a
suitable form of currency. If you want to contribute more, well, who are we to say no to such largesse?
Talk to us if you have limited funds, or if you can help sponsor another camp member!</p>

<p>You can send dues through a Paypal transfer to <i>info@baaahs.org</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="WhenYouArrive">When You Arrive</a></h2>

<p>We will be putting together a camp map. For
the most part, this will indicate where larger vehicles, communal space and
larger camp clusters will be located. When you arrive, please try to find a
Shepherd who can help you get situated. If
you are coming in an RV, have a large vehicle or have specific camp needs, we
will work with you prior to departure so you have a good sense of where and how
to set yourself up.</p>

<p>We generally discourage the use of RVs. They're expensive, they're not particularly
well-suited to the playa, and they tend to have the effect of isolating people. If you're
considering an RV, we can suggest some better alternatives. If you do decide to go with
an RV, please let us know so we can figure out placement.</p>

<h2><a name="WhatCanYouProvide">What Can You Provide?</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Your beautiful selves</li>
  <li>An open heart and mind</li>
  <li>A spirit of adventure and your awakened inner child</li>
  <li>The patience of a saint</li>
  <li>Everything you need to keep alive</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, get creative! Whatever you would like to do for the
BAAAHS Station community, have at it.</p>

<p><b>Decorating The Camp.</b> Want to take our sallow cow patch and turn
it into a surreal meadow of Sheep Chic madness? Go right ahead. If you want to
get together with other flock members, please, please, go ahead and surprise us
(as long as things do not explode).</p>

<p><b>Snacks, Cocktails.</b> Want to plan a snack for the camp, or a
cocktail party, a mid-morning refresh or afternoon high tea? That sounds like a
lovely way to give back to the flock. Even an ice-cold grape or a Popsicle—food
brings us closer together (especially if someone else is feeding you).</p>

<p>Gifting snacks or specialty cocktails throughout the day or during happy hour
is a great way to participate. If you live outside the Bay Area and aren’t able
to help tinker on Pearl, this is a great opportunity to do something nice for
your fellow sheep who have been working year round on the art car. Believe me,
they appreciate a cocktail.</p>

<p>Be creative. Be thoughtful. Be inventive. Get
together with other flock members and have fun.</p>

<h2><a name="Shifts">Shifts</a></h2>

<p>We have a pant-peeingly hold-your-breath
lineup of events for the week. We’ll be sharing that separately.
<a href="/shifts">Shift signup</a> has just gone live. Everyone in camp is asked to sign
up for at least 5 shifts on the playa to keep our awesome camp events running
smoothly. Don't worry, you won't be a slave to the sheep, this will leave plenty
of time to have a full-fledged burn too. Plus, our shifts are pretty much all
awesome opportunities to interact with BRC's finest.</p>

<h2><a name="Virgins">First Timers – Virgins</a></h2>

<p>We love you. <b>We wish we could be you again.</b>
Keep in mind Burning Man can be a wild ride. It’s misery and ecstasy, heaven and hell,
darkness and light. Have no expectations. The environment can be harsh (be very,
very kind to your feet!).
You can become easily over-stimulated (no comment). Just take it in and let it
take you in. Don’t compare and contrast. At its core Burning Man will be your
personal experience as part of the larger community. Take care of yourself.</p>

<p><b>Be Kind.</b> Be kind to your friends and your loved
ones. If you are bringing first timers, please watch out for them. And above
all, drink water. If you are thirsty, you’re probably dehydrated. BEER DOES NOT
COUNT AS WATER. Piss Clear.</p>

<p><b>No MOOP.</b> Old timers know this. Everything that
comes to Burning Man must leave too. That means 100% of garbage. MOOP: Matter
Out Of Place. Throughout the week, make an effort to keep our
camp clean. And when you pack up, you make sure your space is spotless. And I
do mean spotless. Nothing on the ground that didn’t come there naturally. Not a
nail (finger or otherwise), a sequin, a thread. Nothing. For more on what
constitutes MOOP, <a
href="http://www.burningman.com/environment/playa_restoration/">please check this out.</a> </p>

<h2><a name="FinalThoughts">Final Thoughts</a></h2>

<p>Please bear in mind, that over the week,
things will evolve, patience will be strained, brain cells dissolved. Nothing
is set in stone. We ask for that you remain pliable. Together, we are going on a
wonderful, playful, serious, “you’ll shoot your eye out” learning experience.
If you have ideas on how to improve things, we welcome that feedback (but don’t
take it personally if we listen and then do the opposite). At the end of the
day, it’s about us forming a community and giving a big ass amazingly awesome
gift back to the greater playa world. 
Everything else is small in comparison. Please bring your stiff upper
lip and your big girl panties. This is Burning Man. This is BAAAHS. Thank you
and good night.</p>
